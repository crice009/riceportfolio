          Philosophy
        </h2>
        <div class="w3-container">
          <p>Educating the future generation is an essential part of building a working society. I believe all individuals are capable learners, and have important contributions to make to our world. As an educator I focus on curating experiences in the classroom through students’ observations, experiments, and reflections to foster their curiosity. This includes supporting students’ wellbeing and creativity, through a growth mindset and design thinking.</p>
          <p>All people are creative, capable of making things they care about, and have important contributions to make to our world. As a maker I exercise my own growth mindset and pursue projects to continually expand my skills or help those near me. Further, as a maker-educator, I believe that making is a great equalizer among students of all ages; where everyone can learn, and differentiated instrution is quintessential rather than an add-on. The tactile nature of learning in FabLabs and Makerspaces also bring accessability to difficult required topics: where better to learn about electricity, or geometry?</p>
          <p>My broader Philosophy about life is to work my hardest, and do my best to be kind to others. We are all trying to make our mark in this world, and need to rely on each other to get there.</p>

              Daniel Hand High School is the only high school of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.madison.k12.ct.us/">Madison Public Schools</a> and annually graduates about 250 students.
              The town itself is nestled along the Connecticut shoreline, and has a strong academic and athletic reputation. In my time there I taught a range of classes, and was involved in a number of committees and clubs.
              and collaborated with a small team to develop a new Fab Lab. This involved creating a budget, meeting with the schoolboard multiple times, ordering equipment, and supporting the development 
              of a community of teachers that felt confident using the lab with their courses.

              Developed the first long-form course for a community nonprofit, and helped jump-started their

              “Foundations of Fabrication” is a 6-month course that teaches adults skills of digital and traditional design and fabrication.
              The course is designed to be a broad introduction to all things available at MakeHaven, and to build a community of makers.
              Critically, the course changed over the years to adapt to feedback from students and the community.

              Mayfield City Schools is a suburban district of Cleveland, OH. The high school has about 1,200 students, 
              and graduates about 300 students annually. In my time there I taught a range of classes, and was involved 
              in a number of committees and clubs. I also helped develop the district’s first Fab Lab, and with several 
              other innovative initiatives over the years. Mayfield is regularly ranked as one of Ohio’s top districts.

              In collaboration with the district Library Department Coordinator and Assistant Superintendent, we planned and 
              rolled out the first registered FabLab at the secondary level in the state of Connecticut. This involved presentations 
              to the school board, planning and managing $60k in purchases, setting-up and maintaining the equipment, offering 
              teacher Professional Development, and more. The FabLab was primarily used by “Independent Project” students, but 
              teachers of nearly all disciplines used the “HandMade” lab in some capacity to enrich their class projects. Also, 
              a transitional plan was enacted so that the lab could keep functioning after my departure.

            <p>Designed and built a robot bartender that can serve drinks. A series of medical grade pumps move liquids from bottles to a serving glass for further mixing. The interface is a full-stack website that is built with an asynchronous server to handle all the physical actions without slowing down the website interface experience. Multiple iterations of custom designed, hand soldered circuit boards were developed to have fine-tuned motor control, an integrated scale, and a hardware overflow shutoff.</p>
            <p>This project was undertaken because it allowed for a complex coding task, while keeping the needed electronics and 3D design tasks relatively simple. It was my first exploration of full-stack web development. Using the robot is as easy as connecting to my personal WIFI, ordering a drink from the menu, and it is made within 30 seconds. Future iterations will further separate the synchronous and asynchronous servers, so a single database can serve shared recipes across multiple robots. </p>

            <p>Students soon used the table as an artist canvas, writing their name, drawing and painting across the surfaces. A few weeks later, it was determined that another table would be helpful in the space, and so it was made. This time, with “#theOption” engraved in its surface. </p>

            <h6 class="w3-text-teal"><i class="fa fa-calendar fa-fw w3-margin-right"></i>Sept 2018</h6>
            <p>The wildcat is the mascot of Mayfield High School, and this is was a personal expression of school pride for homecoming. A jacket was purchased with a plain black back. The powercat logo was turned into a sewing pattern, and cut into a template. A continuous electroluminescent (EL) wire was sewn onto the back of the jacket. Electrical access was added to a front pocket to accommodate a power supply and controller circuit.</p>
            <p>The EL wire can be powered directly from an inverting battery pack. However, since this was to be used at a pep rally, a second controller was hacked into, so the jacket could respond to ambient noise levels in real time. Motion sensors were also added, so the jacket would light up when the wearer dances.</p>

            <p>A collaboration among elementary art teachers, and district technology coordinators led to a series of STEAM themed field trips to the high school Fab Lab. These field trips gave elementary and middle school students the opportunity to learn in the Fab Lab and access technology not available at their respective schools. In this series, technology was used to investigate various art concepts.</p>
            <p>Shown here, are third grade students exploring the artistic styles of Jackson Pollack. An art canvas has been spread on the floor within a plywood constraint. Paint was placed onto the canvas and the students drove Sphero robots through the paint to create a collaborative masterpiece. They controlled the robots by either by remote control or coded motions. Over the course of the day, several groups of students collaborated to make a large painting which were taken back to their elementary school for display.</p>

            <p>I partnered with two local Fab Academy students to build a <a target="_blank" href="http://archive.fabacademy.org/archives/2017/fablablccc/students/43/09mechmachine/">candle making machine</a>. My role was to design the structure of the robot. After making a prototype out of cardboard, the next version was made out of wood and metal. The final parts were cut on the CNC and laser cutter. Electronics were the built from the newest Machines That Make modules. In the end, our new machine was built to automatically do something very old – make candles by dipping wicks into molten wax. </p>

            <p>I was able to help engineering students <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vTyCuwR_v65CixGb2gD1BMIpQRObpHcNp2YuKAP5SdmaA4shDLURpvybGDp3IuPLPvZq8vyHz5lhCD5/pub?start=false&loop=false&delayms=5000&slide=id.gd9c453428_0_16">design and build GPS motion trackers that were taken on roller coasters</a> to log data. Later, positional information was analyzed by math students. This project represented a massive collaboration with a math teacher, district administration and Progressive Insurance engineers. Students were broken into teams that purchased electronics and used collected resources to make operational GPS dataloggers.</p>
            <p>The students made connections across their classes, and applied skills to study real-world events. The engineering students had to meet a strict deadline of having their GPS unit ready to work before the class trip to Cedar Point. The math students needed to make piecewise functions and graphs of the data to describe the observed motion, and separate the signal from noise. All of this student effort was centered around designing solutions and project-based learning, beyond the context of any single class.</p>

            <p>A team of students worked together to build a system of sensors and a webserver to monitor the growing conditions in a container garden. In order to develop this project, a partnership with Progressive Insurance engineers was established. Progressive volunteered three engineers for an afternoon of design thinking and guidance. They also provided the students with a grant to fund this and future projects. The system eventually used a distributed network of Arduinos and a Raspberry Pi to manage this early internet of things project.  </p>
